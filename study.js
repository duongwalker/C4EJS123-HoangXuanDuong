// Bai 1

// Cau 1. 
// - Var is the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable. 
// - "Const" specifies that a variable's value is constant and tells the compiler to prevent the programmer from modifying it.
// 
// Cau 2. The differences between "let" and "var":
//      - "let": 
//      + "let" declarations are block scoped. 
//      + "let" variables CAN be updated but CAN'T be re-declared within its scope (inside {}).
//      + "let" variables ARE NOT initialized when hoisted.
//      
//      - "var": 
//      + "var" declarations are globally scoped or function scoped. 
//      + "var" variables CAN be updated AND re-declared WITHIN ITS SCOPE.
//      + "var" variables ARE initialized with "undefined" when hoisted.
// 
// Cau 3. The differences between "let" and "const":
//      - "let": 
//      + "let" variables CAN be updated but CAN'T be re-declared.
//      + "let" variables can be declared without being initialized.
//      
//      - "const":
//      + "const" variables CAN neither be updated but nor re-declared.
//      + "const" must be initialized during declaration.  
// 
// Cau 4.
// - All of them can be used to declare variables.
// - Using var might cause a lot of bugs, while using "let" and "const" has less problems.
// - "Let" can be used most of the time in order to declare variables without causing bugs like "var" does.
// - You can use "const" when you want your variables to maintain constant values.

// Bai 2:

// Cau 1. Boolean is a datatype that returns either of two values: true or false.

// Cau 2: Things that result in Boolean
// - Boolean
// - Comparisons
// - Operations of Boolean
// - Other data types
