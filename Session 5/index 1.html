<p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life, "Paul Chowder, the tittle character of Nicholson Baker's novel " <a href = #>The Anthologist</a>'', scrawls in the margins of Oliver's <a href = #>New and Selected Poems, Volume One.</a>" A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has something."

            I don't know exactly what a prayer is.
            I do know how to pay attentionm how to fall down
            into the grass, how to knee; down in the grass, 
            how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fileds,
            which is what I have been doing all day.

The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.
